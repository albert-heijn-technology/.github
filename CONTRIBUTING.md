# Contributing

Please feel free to contribute and join the community! This community abides by the [CNCF code of conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).
Here is an excerpt:

_As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities._

## AI tool use policy

Use of AI-assisted tools, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and code generation assistants, is permitted when contributing to this project.

### Human-in-the-loop requirement

Contributors must read and review all AI-generated code or text before submitting it for review by other project members.
AI tools are assistants, not substitutes for human judgment.

### Authorship and accountability

The contributor is always the author and is fully accountable for their contributions,
regardless of using AI tools in their creation or not.
By submitting a contribution, you confirm that:

* You have reviewed and understand all code or text in your contribution.
* You have verified the contribution meets project standards and guidelines.
* You take full responsibility for the correctness, security, and quality of the contribution.

### Best practices

* Disclose the use of AI tools in your contribution description.
* Review AI-generated code for security vulnerabilities, licensing issues, and correctness.
* Test all AI-generated code thoroughly before submission.
* Do not submit AI output that you do not understand.
* Be prepared to explain and defend any part of your contribution during code review.
