# Support

We keep track of problems, suggestions and questions using GitHub Issues.
This lets us keep everything in one place.
(So, please don't email the developers directly unless you have a personal question.)

First, before submitting an issue, search the existing issues (open and closed) to make sure someone else has not already reported the same problem or asked the same question.
Please only comment on an existing **open** issue if you are fairly sure your problem/question is *exactly* the same.
If the issue is closed or you are not sure your problem is the same, open a new issue instead.

## Discord

Discord is a platform that hosts public and private communities.
You can find developers and other users on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/MUpMjP2).
It is a great way to ask quick questions or carry on a conversation.
